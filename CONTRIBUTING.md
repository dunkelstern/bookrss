# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, all contributions are welcome!

## So you did find a bug?

Great, please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/dunkelstern/bookrss/issues) and describe what went wrong and how we can reproduce this. Please watch the space for questions we might have that are not immediately obvious after submitting the ticket. We try to answer all tickets within a week.

### Even got a fix?

Cool, please fork the repository, create a new branch from the `develop` branch and commit your fix there. Then switch over to the original repo and send a pull request. We will investigate and comment on the fix if there's something not quite right.

Please make sure not to commit your fix directly to the develop branch as it will be more complicated to merge later on when the development progresses after the fix.  

## Want to improve documentation?

Documentation is needed for every successful project, we know that and you're welcome to improve anything. We appreciate different viewing angles from outside the project as we as developers may always be a bit biased as to what is needed for users to understand all implications of using this library as a dependency.

So if you have usage examples or want to clear up things that are too poorly documented please feel free to write or change documentation and send pull requests or add information to the wiki. When there's stuff in the wiki that is worth including in the documentation we will migrate it into the official documentation. We see the wiki as some kind of a playground to outline what the documentation should look like.

## Do you miss any features?

So you have an idea for the next killer-feature or just a small thing to fix an annoyance you've run into? Go to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/dunkelstern/bookrss/issues) and open a ticket. If you have example code that you would like to use to illustrate the idea this is even better. Please be aware that we will read and comment on the feature request within a week, but it may take longer to implement when we have decided that it's a good idea.

Feel free to start implementation yourself if you feel up to it and send a pull request. Please send the pull request while referencing the ticket number (just include `#` followed by the ticket number somewhere in the description) so we can see what it is for. If you're not sure how to implement something please send a pull request even with unfinished code so we can comment and help each other out with the details.
